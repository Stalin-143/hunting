# A07 - Identification and Authentication Failures

## Description
Previously known as Broken Authentication, this category includes failures related to user identity, authentication, and session management. This can allow attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or exploit implementation flaws to assume other users' identities.

## Common Vulnerabilities
- Weak password requirements
- Credential stuffing
- Broken session management
- Missing multi-factor authentication
- Insecure password recovery
- Session fixation

## Testing Approach
Test authentication mechanisms, session handling, password policies, and account recovery processes.
