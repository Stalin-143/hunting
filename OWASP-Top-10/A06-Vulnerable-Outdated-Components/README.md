# A06 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components

## Description
Components run with the same privileges as the application itself, so flaws in any component can result in serious impact. Applications using components with known vulnerabilities may undermine application defenses and enable various attacks and impacts.

## Common Vulnerabilities
- Outdated libraries
- Unpatched systems
- Vulnerable dependencies
- End-of-life software
- Unknown component inventory

## Testing Approach
Identify component versions, check for known CVEs, analyze dependency trees, and use vulnerability scanners.
