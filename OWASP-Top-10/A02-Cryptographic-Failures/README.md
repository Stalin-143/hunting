# A02 - Cryptographic Failures

## Description
Previously known as Sensitive Data Exposure, this category focuses on failures related to cryptography which often lead to exposure of sensitive data. Common issues include weak cryptographic algorithms, improper key management, and data transmitted in clear text.

## Common Vulnerabilities
- Weak encryption algorithms
- Hardcoded credentials
- Insecure key storage
- Data transmitted in clear text
- Missing encryption

## Testing Approach
Look for sensitive data exposure through weak or missing encryption, analyze SSL/TLS configurations, and check for hardcoded secrets.
