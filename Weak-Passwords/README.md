# Weak Passwords

## Description
Weak password vulnerabilities occur when systems allow or use passwords that are easily guessable or commonly used. This includes default passwords, dictionary words, and simple patterns that can be easily compromised through brute force or dictionary attacks.

## Common Attack Vectors
- Login forms
- Account creation
- Password reset
- Administrative interfaces
- Default credentials on devices/services

## Testing Approach
Test systems with common weak passwords, default credentials, and dictionary words to identify weak password policies or default configurations.

## Payloads
See `weak-passwords-payloads.txt` for a comprehensive list of common weak passwords and default credentials.
