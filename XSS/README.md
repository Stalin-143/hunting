# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

## Description
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user.

## Types of XSS
- **Reflected XSS**: Script is reflected off the web server
- **Stored XSS**: Script is permanently stored on the target server
- **DOM-based XSS**: Vulnerability exists in client-side code

## Common Attack Vectors
- Input fields
- URL parameters
- HTTP headers
- File uploads
- Comment sections

## Testing Approach
Submit JavaScript code in various input points and observe if the code gets executed in the browser.

## Payloads
See `xss-payloads.txt` for a comprehensive list of XSS payloads.
